# CustomStringClass
This project implements a custom String class in C++ . It includes deep copy, move semantics, dynamic memory management, and operator overloading for intuitive string handling.
## ✨ Features  
✔ **SSO (Small String Optimization)** – Uses a fixed buffer for small strings, reducing heap allocations.  
✔ **Copy and Move Semantics** – Supports deep copy, move constructor, and move assignment.  
✔ **Operator Overloading** – Implements `+`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `[]`, `<<`, and `>>`.  
✔ **Memory Safety** – Manages dynamic memory properly to avoid leaks.  
✔ **Efficient Concatenation** – Optimized string concatenation with heap allocation only when needed.
